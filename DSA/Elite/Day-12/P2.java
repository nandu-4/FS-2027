/*
A software development company is designing a smart home automation 
system that uses sensor networks to monitor and control different devices 
in a house. The sensors are organized in a hierarchical structure, where each 
sensor node has a unique ID and can have up to two child nodes (left and right).

The company wants to analyze the left-most sensors in the system to determine
which ones are critical for detecting environmental changes. The hierarchy of 
the sensors is provided as a level-order input, where missing sensors are 
represented as -1.

Your task is to build the sensor network as a binary tree and then determine 
the left-most sensor IDs at each level.

Refernce Node:
--------------
class TreeNode {
    Integer val;
    TreeNode left, right;
    
    TreeNode(Integer val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = this.right = null;
    }
}


Input Format:
-------------
Space separated integers, elements of the tree.

Output Format:
--------------
A list of integers representing the left-most sensor IDs at each level


Sample Input-1:
---------------
1 2 3 4 -1 -1 5

Sample Output-1:
----------------
[1, 2, 4]



Sample Input-2:
---------------
3 2 4 1 5

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[3, 2, 1]
