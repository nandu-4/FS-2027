/*
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.

We say that an integer x is expressible from nums if there exist some integers 
0 <= index1 < index2 < ... < indexk < nums.length for which 
nums[index1] | nums[index2] | ... | nums[indexk] = x. 
In other words, an integer is expressible if it can be written as the bitwise OR
of some subsequence of nums.

Return the minimum positive non-zero integer that is not expressible from nums.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
2
2 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
4

Explanation: 
------------
1 and 2 are already present in the array. We know that 3 is expressible, 
since nums[0] | nums[1] = 2 | 1 = 3. 
Since 4 is not expressible, we return 4.

Sample Input-2:
---------------
3
5 3 2

Sample Output-2: 
----------------
1

Explanation: We can show that 1 is the smallest number that is not expressible.
 

Constraints:
------------
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
