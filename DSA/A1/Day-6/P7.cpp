/*
Given an array of integers where all elements occur twice except exactly two elements, 
which occur only once, your task is to find these two non-repeated elements.

You must print the two non-repeating elements in the order they are found.

Input Format
------------
First line contains an integer N — size of the array.
Second line contains N space-separated integers.

Output Format
---------------
Print the two non-repeated integers, separated by space.

Constraints
-----------
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
Array will contain exactly two unique elements and all others repeated twice.

Input:
------
8
2 3 7 9 2 3 9 11

Output:
--------
7  11

Explanation:
------------
2,3,9 are repeated twice → ignored
