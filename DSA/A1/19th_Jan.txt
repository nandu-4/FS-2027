/*
Given a binary array, find the index of 0 to be replaced with 1 to get a maximum 
length sequence of continuous ones.
For example, consider array { 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1 }. The index to be 
replaced is 7 to get a continuous sequence of length 6 containing all 1’s.
Note if no replacement is possible then print -1

Example:
input=10
0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1
output=7

Example 2:
input=12
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
output=11

Example 3:
input=12
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
output=0

Example 4:
input=10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
output=-1

/*A string is good if there are no repeated characters.
Given a string s, return the number of good substrings of length three in s.
Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every 
occurrence should be counted.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

Example 1:
input: s = "xyzzaz"
output: 1

Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 
The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aababcabc"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", 
"bca", "cab", and "abc".
The good substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".

/*You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right.
 The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.
You want to collect as much fruit as possible. 

However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:
You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. 
There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree)
 while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.

Sample cases:

case 1:
Input: 
3
1 2 1
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.

Case  2:
Input: 
4
0 1 2 2 
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].

case 3:
Input: 
5
1 2 3 2 2
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].

A tenth standard student has been given a task, Given P number of subject marks 
and a number I, He has to print the I-th least value of sums among all the 
possible sub-arrays of marks.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two space separated inetegers, P and I.
Line-2: P space separated integers, marks[].

Output Format:
--------------
Print the I-th least value of possible sums.

Sample Input-1:
--------------
3 4
3 2 4

Sample output-1:
---------------
5

Explanation: 
------------
The subarrays of 3 2 4 are:
1st subarray: 3 the sum is 3
2nd subarray: 2 the sum is 2
3rd subarray: 4 the sum is 4
4th subarray: 3,2 the sum is 5
5th subarray: 2,4 the sum is 6
6th subarray: 3,2,4 the sum is 9

The 4th smallest is 5

Sample Input-2:
---------------
4 7
2 2 4 4

Sample output-2:
----------------
8

Explanation: 
------------
The subarrays of 2 2 4 4 are

1st subarray: 2 the sum is 2

There are N number of small cartoons and each cartoon will have a balloon of 
some color identified by a number. You are asked to select fixed number of 
P-cartoons as a subset every time and find the number of unique colored 
balloons in the number of cartoons "P" you pick everytime.

The resultant cartoons ans will be N-P+1 and return it.

The number of distinct number of balloons is:
    nums[i:i+p-1] = [nums[i], nums[i+1], ..., nums[i+p-1]].


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two space separated integers, N and P
Line-2: N space separated integers, nums[]

Output Format:
--------------
Print the (N-P+1) integers as output.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
7 4
1 2 2 3 3 4 4

Sample Output-1:
----------------
3 2 3 2

Explanation: 
------------
The number of distinct elements in each subarray of size P goes as follows:
- nums[0:3] = [1,2,2,3] so ans[0] = 3
- nums[1:4] = [2,2,3,3] so ans[1] = 2
- nums[2:5] = [2,3,3,4] so ans[2] = 3
- nums[3:6] = [3,3,4,4] so ans[3] = 2


Sample Input-2:
---------------
6 3
1 1 1 1 1 1

Sample Output-2:
----------------
1 1 1 1

Explanation:
------------
The number of distinct elements in each subarray goes as follows:
- nums[0:2] = [1,1,1] so ans[0] = 1
- nums[1:3] = [1,1,1] so ans[1] = 1
- nums[2:4] = [1,1,1] so ans[2] = 1
- nums[3:5] = [1,1,1] so ans[3] = 1


Sample Input-3:
