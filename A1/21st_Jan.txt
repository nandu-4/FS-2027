Two brothers want to play a game, 
The rules of the game are: one player gives two sorted lists of 
numerical elements and a number (sum). 
The opponent has to find the closest pair of elements 
to the given sum.
-> pair consists of elements from each list

two sorted lists as input and return a pair as output.

You are given three sorted integer arrays A[], B[], and C[], and an integer 
target.
Your task is to find one element from each array (A[i], B[j], and C[k]) such 
that the sum of these three elements is equal to target.

If there is no exact match, return the triplet with the minimum absolute 
difference to the target.

Input Format:
-------------
Line 1: An integer N, the size of the first array.
Line 2: N space-separated integers representing elements of array A.
Line 3: An integer M, the size of the second array.
Line 4: M space-separated integers representing elements of array B.
Line 5: An integer P, the size of the third array.
Line 6: P space-separated integers representing elements of array C.
Line 7: An integer target, the required sum.

Output Format:
--------------
Line-1: Print the triplet (A[i], B[j], C[k]) that either matches the target or 
has the closest sum to the target.

Constraints:
------------
Time Complexity: O(N + M + P)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Andy and Berry are serving water to n guests sitting in a line.
Each guest needs a certain amount of water.

Andy starts serving from the left end (guest 0).
Berry starts serving from the right end (guest n−1).
Both move towards the center.

Each of them has a water jar:
Andy’s jar has capacity: capacityA
Berry’s jar has capacity: capacityB

Initially, both jars are full.

Before serving a guest:
If the jar does not have enough water, it must be refilled.

Refilling is instant.

When both reach the same guest, the person who has more water serves that guest.
If both have the same amount, Andy serves.

Your task is to calculate how many times the jars are refilled to serve all 
guests.

Input Format:
------------------------------------------
An integer n – number of guests
n integers – water required by each guest
Integer capacityA – Andy’s jar capacity
Integer capacityB – Berry’s jar capacity

Output Format:
----------------------------------
Print a single integer:
the total number of refills required

You are given an array of integers.
Your task is to determine whether there exists any pair of two distinct elements
in the array whose sum equals a given target value.

If such a pair exists, print 1.
Otherwise, print 0.

Note:
------
You may not use the same element twice.
You need to sort the array.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N, representing the size of the array.
Line-2: N space-separated integers, representing the array elements.
Line-3: An integer X, representing the target sum.

Output Format:
-----------------
Print 1 if a pair exists whose sum equals X, otherwise print 0.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
-10^9 ≤ array[i] ≤ 10^9
-10^9 ≤ X ≤ 10^9

Sample Input:
-------------
4
1 4 2 5

Given a non-empty string s and an abbreviation abbr, return whether the string 
matches with the given abbreviation.
A string such as "word" contains only the following valid abbreviations:
["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2", "1o1d", "1or1", 
"w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]

Notice that only the above abbreviations are valid abbreviations of the string 
"word". 
Any other string is not a valid abbreviation of "word".

Note: Assume s contains only lowercase letters and abbr contains only lowercase 
letters and digits.
Example 1:
Given s = "internationalization", abbr = "i12iz4n":

Return true.

Example 2:
Given s = "apple", abbr = "a2e":

Return false.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n=max(len(word),len(abbr))
Auxiliary Space:  O(1).
